# *Steam Orange* for Steamâ„¢
**Steam Orange** is a skin for **Steam** that I initially created just for my personal pleasure, because I didn't like the cold, blue colors of Steam. So basicially, this skin turns every button, or label which was previously blue into shades of orange.

### How to Install
It's simple. Go to the releases tab, and click on *"Source Code (.zip)"* under the release description.
Then jump to your Steam directory and open up the folder *"skins"*. In there, create a folder named after whatever you want, but I'd prefer *"OrangeSteam"*, so you can identify it among others. Open up that new folder, and copy in all the files you downloaded in the zip archive. Now, just restart / open Steam, click to *"Steam"* in the top bar, and select *"Settings"*. Click on the *"Interface"* tab on the left, and in the skin dropdown, select the skin which is named after the folder you created. You're done!
